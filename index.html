 <h2> About Me </h2>
 <p> Greetings! My name is Lindsay Gypin, and <a href="https://www.mypronouns.org/what-and-why">I use she/her pronouns</a>. I grew up in Denver, Colorado on the <a href="https://native-land.ca/">anscestral lands of the Cheyenne, Arapahoe, and Ute</a> and began my career as a K-12 educator. I taught high school English and worked as a school librarian before becoming disillusioned with the politicization of public education and determining my skills were better suited for work in public libraries. Attending library school after having worked in libraries for so many years, I found myself drawn to courses on research data management and qualitative research methods. Although I greatly enjoy working with youth, I decided to focus my efforts on effecting change at the systemic level through research, scholarship, and working with future leaders, rather than the individual level by working with youth in public libraries. I recently became the Data Services Librarian at the University of North Carolina Greensboro, where I hope to assist scholars in making their research data more open and accessible.</p>
 <p>In my personal life, I played roller derby for nearly a decade. I quit when the combined commitment of school and derby became too intense to be successful in both. The roller derby community is a highly diverse international community, and through the personal connections I made, I saw firsthand the effects of white supremacy culture. I discovered that I had been complicit in racism, sexism, and homophobia and have been striving to do better, to help others do better, and to break down systems of oppression. For some time, I have wanted to build a reproducible workflow to uncover systemic bias in library catalogs. I am working on forming a research team to work on this issue using data science and machine learning.</p>
